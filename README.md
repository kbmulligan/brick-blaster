brick-blaster
=================

brick-blaster is a clone of a basic brick-breaking game.

It's written in Javascript and relies on the pixi.js API for Canvas/WebGL support.

It utilizes the Tink library for input control. Thanks to kittykatattack for excellent libraries and an very helpful pixi.js tutorial.

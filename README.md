brick-blaster
=================

brick-blaster is a clone of a basic [brick-breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_clone) game.

It's written in Javascript and relies on the [pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) API for Canvas/WebGL support.

It utilizes the [Tink](https://github.com/kittykatattack/tink) library for input control. Thanks to [kittykatattack](https://github.com/kittykatattack) for [excellent libraries](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi#takingitfurther) and an [very helpful pixi.js tutorial](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi).


DISCLAIMER: The code is formatted and constructed terribly. It's a noob's forray into Javascript.
